# 💧 AI Water Usage Estimator

This is an AI-powered web app that estimates the water usage behind every AI query. Built to raise awareness about the often invisible environmental costs of AI compute.

## 🌐 Live Demo
https://ai-water-usage-estimator.streamlit.app/

## 🔧 Built With
- Streamlit (Frontend & Deployment)
- OpenAI API (LLM integration)
- Python 3
- Secrets management via Streamlit Cloud

## 🔬 How it works
The app estimates water consumption using published proxy values based on model type (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4o). Future versions will introduce dynamic token-level estimations for more precise real-time feedback.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Token-based dynamic water usage calculations
- Model comparisons
- Leaderboards or gamification for public awareness
- Educational dashboards

## 🔐 Secrets Managed Securely:
- OpenAI API key managed via Streamlit Secrets.
